 **Data Structure and Algorithms**
 <br>
 _Notes available in Comments with Diagrams for Easy Understanding._
 
 
Practise Repository to enhance Basic and Advanced Datastructure knowledge, according to the various coding scenarios in different programing Languages.

#Focus:
<ul>
  <li> Major focus of this repository is on self learing and self coding aspects. </li>
  </ul>
# Programing Languages:
<ol>
  <li> C++ </li>
  <li> JAVA 8 </li>
  <li> Python </li>
  </ol>
#Key Features
<ul>
  <li> Datastructure with C++ </li>
  <li> Datastructure with Java 8 </li>
  <li> Datastructure Python </li>
</ul>
